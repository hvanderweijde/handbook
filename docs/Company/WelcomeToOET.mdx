# Welcome to OET!

Hi there! Welcome to Team OET! We're very happy to have you join us and be part of our mission. This Handbook page is dedicated to your getting started with OET (onboarding information). There's some really important information for you here, so please read through this page fully. If you have any onboarding or other People-related questions, feel free to contact our Head of People, Quintin Coetzee.

## 1. Signing your contract
Please review and sign your contract as the first step. Ensure all details are correct, and feel free to ask our Head of People, [Quintin](mailto:quintin.coetzee@openenergytransition.org) or our Head of Operations and Strategy, [Victor](mailto:victor.martinez@openenergytransition.org) if you have any questions. The People Team will securely file your contract, but you should always keep a copy at hand in your own device(s) or storage.

### Laptop and delivery information
If you need a laptop for your role, please provide your **delivery address** so we can arrange for it to be shipped to you. Please also kindly let us know if you prefer Windows or Mac devices. Further, please  let us know if there is any required access control information that we should give to the courier, as well as if there are any unsuitable days or times for delivery.

## 2. Productivity tools: your Google Workspace account
You have access to Google Workspace through your OET account. This includes all main Google Applications: Gmail, Calendar, Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, etc.. Use **Google Meet** for external calls ()please try and ensure that you have a neat, peaceful place that is conducive to constructive external communication to host your calls). After signing your contract, you will need to sign in to your Google account. You will receive a link to create the account along with a **temporary password** in the email.

**Important:** Enter the temporary password included in the email you received and make sure to **change it right away** for security purposes.

Make sure to set up a profile picture, a password (use a teammate’s signature as an example). It is also recommended to open a [Cal.com](https://cal.com/) and integrate it with your organizational Google Calendar, and include this link in your signature, so people can book meetings without the usual availability ping-pong needed to agree on dates and times!

*Please also attend to this within 24 hours of receiving the email, to avoid it timing out. If it does time out, please let us know, and we’ll resend it.*

### Google Drive
Project folder access is granted as needed. To request access, contact the relevant project lead / manager.
You will, however, have unrestricted access to the following folders from the start:
: Has useful formatted OET-branded templates and files that could serve as a starting point for projects and tasks.
If you develop a file that can be of general use, please upload it there!
Has minutes and presentations of internal meetings, such as the weekly Tuesday meeting and knowledge-sharing sessions

## 3. Everyday communications: Discord
**Discord** is important for more than just meetings—it’s a central hub for our internal communication. It helps if you take a look and get a sense of how we communicate, what we’re working on, and allows you to stay updated on team discussions, project statuses, and any announcements.
Using Discord instead of Teams can be quite a change for many! If you’re new to the platform, it would be a great idea to watch a [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5c6Bc-S0TI)
You should have received an invitation to join the OET Discord channel in your welcome email. If you did not, please reach out to whoever you have been liaising with to request that they share the link.
We use the OET Discord channel for most internal communications. It’s a versatile platform with spaces for text and voice communication, and it’s where we encourage you to:
- Hold internal meetings
- Collaborate in co-working sessions
- Engage in topic- and project-specific discussions
You will receive a "Welcome to OET" email with detailed instructions on how to join our **Discord channel**, along with the **Laptop and delivery** and **First Day Information**

### Welcome Message
Make sure to go to the #welcome channel and say hi to your new teammates! Feel free to personalize your message, and say a bit about yourself, your background and what you will be working on. This is a great time opportunity to make a great impression!

### Prio Talk Thread
- Everyone has a "prio talk" thread in the Discussion channel that must be updated every Monday with:
- A list of upcoming tasks in priority order.
- Ongoing updates by moving tasks from "Doing" to "Done."
- A "Backlog" section (can be separated and pinned to the thread) if you have things that are in the "back burner" but are still important.
Use **Markdown** format for titles and bullets (follow examples from Max or Victor's thread). Markdown enhances readability and consistency; ChatGPT or other LLMs can help you convert files to Markdown or structure them using this format from the get-go.
If you’re new at OET and are unsure of what to add to this section, please ask your manager or whomever assigns you tasks. It’s totally fine if they’re just ideas or suggestions.

## 4. First Day Information
On your first day, you will receive additional information on what to expect, including details for any **introductory calls**. One of these will be with our Head of People, Quintin Coetzee. He will schedule this at a time that is convenient for both of you, generally within your first 2 weeks with OET.
You may need to **book meetings** in Google Calendar if they are not scheduled by us. When doing so for external meetings, please ensure that a link to Google Meet is included (it should be by default). For internal meetings, whenever possible, please remove this link, and add the Discord channel you intend to use in the “place” field of the meeting, as we prefer to hold internal meetings over Discord whenever possible.
Please feel free to reach out to Quintin with any onboarding questions. He’ll be happy to answer them.

## 5. Code Development: GitHub
**GitHub** is our primary tool for code development and collaboration. Please:
- Share the email associated with your GitHub account so we can add you to the OET Organization. Feel free to alert [Sid](siddharth.krishna@openenergytransition.org) or someone else from the software development team so they can enable this for you. If you don’t already have a (free) account, please create one .
- Use it to coordinate with peers, co-develop code, and contribute to our open-source libraries.

## 6. internal knowledge management
### **OET Handbook**
The **OET Handbook** is our centralized online resource for policies, procedures, and guidelines. It is accessible to all OET members and can be modified collaboratively. Please familiarize yourself with it, its style guide, and its contribution guide (all within the Handbook).
Remember:
- **It's a Work in Progress**: Many pages in the Handbook are still placeholders; if you are looking for specific information and cannot find it, please reach out to the Operations Team (Victor, or Cristina).
- **Be Proactive!**: The Handbook is not only a place for you to get information, but also for you to contribute information. If you have a section you would like to add or develop, take initiative, check internally first, and then feel free to go ahead!

## 7.  Other Administrative Tools
### Remote.com
**Remote.com**, our partner Employer of Record, is used for employment-related processes, such as contract management, payroll, and absence requests. Please continually ensure that your profile is up-to-date, and reach out to the People team for any questions.
[Link to Remote.com](https://remote.com/)

### Navan
**Navan** is used for travel and, soon, also for expense management. Once you’ve received your invitation to join the platform, please create an account, and then use this platform to book travel and submit expense reports as needed.
[Link to Navan](https://navan.com/)

### greenhouse
Only team members involved with hiring will interact with **Greenhouse**. This platform is used to:
- Create or modify job openings.
- Manage recruitment workflows.
- Interview and correspond with candidates.
If you are asked to support recruitment activities, you will receive specific guidance, likely from Quintin. If you have any questions about the platform, please reach out to him.

## 8. Time Tracking
We track team member hours, definitely not to micromanage, but rather to importantly plan our overarching work pipeline, make key business development and hiring decisions, and manage project contributions effectively. Please:
- Open, bookmark and look for your name in the [OET Staff Time Tracking file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14tylZ6-eXqwenQeFgwO0aEkrldpsPzvGf9U5C16s-1E/edit?usp=sharing)
- Fill out the time tracking boxes next to your name in the “Time tracking” sheet with the respective hours for each task and month.
- Liaise with your project leads to estimate the time commitment for each task.
- If a task code is missing, reach out to Victor or Cristina to request one (do NOT create one yourself).
Please fill this out as far forwards as possible. You can always go back in and edit your estimates or assumptions later. They may very well change over time. Go to the "Time Tracking" sheet, find your name, select the tasks and projects you'll be spending time on (including bank holidays and other overheads), and fill the corresponding boxes.
Full-time commitments (i.e., 160 hours per month) at any given time should be tracked in advance for at least the following two months. If you are unsure regarding your assignments, please reach out.
